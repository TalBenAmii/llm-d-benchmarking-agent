# FEATURES — what this project does and how to see / verify each piece

> A single, evidence-backed inventory of **every feature** on `main`
> (MVP → roadmap v1 phases 0–10 → v2 phases 11–18 → v3 phases 19–26 → token-tracking →
> ROADMAP_V4 phases 27–66 — all active phases merged, 7 explicitly deferred (34/43/44/47/52/57/58)
> — → todo-batch follow-ups), with a concrete way to **see or verify** each one.
>
> **Read this first — why "the app looks unchanged":** most recent work is *backend / ops /
> trust / quality* plumbing that has **no chat-UI surface by design** (structured logging,
> auth, rate-limiting, allowlist governance, run lifecycle, workspace GC, CI quality gates).
> Only a handful of commits touched the visible chat. So "I can't see changes in the app" is
> expected — the changes are at the HTTP/WS, cluster, security, and CI surfaces, not in the
> chat bubbles. This file shows you where each one actually lives.

**Legend for the "How to see / verify" column**
- 🟢 **verified live in this session** — I ran it against the running app and observed the output (see the [Evidence log](#evidence-log) at the bottom).
- 🔵 **driveable in the browser/cluster** — observable by using the chat UI or a kind cluster (needs the LLM key, which is configured, and/or a cluster).
- ⚪ **artifact / config** — verify by rendering an artifact or reading a file; no live server needed.

## 0. The one-paragraph map

A local **chat assistant** (FastAPI backend + static chat UI over a WebSocket) that drives the
`llm-d-benchmark` CLI for non-experts: it interviews you, plans a run, checks preconditions,
deploys an llm-d stack, runs a benchmark, parses the report against the repo's schema, and
explains the numbers. Around that core sit a **Kubernetes-native orchestrator**, a **results
analyzer** (SLO/goodput/Pareto), **cross-session history + trends**, **Prometheus
observability**, a **deny-by-default security allowlist + per-action approval**, **optional
auth/rate-limit/CORS**, **run lifecycle** (cancel/reattach/readiness), **workspace GC**, a
**one-command Helm/Kustomize deploy**, and a **token-usage counter + prompt caching**. All
*judgment* lives in editable `knowledge/` files; Python is mechanism only.

---

## 1. How to launch it and see everything yourself

```bash
cd llm-d-benchmarking-agent-project
cp .env.example .env            # set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or an OpenAI-compatible key (already configured here)
pip install -e .                # or: uv pip install -e .
uvicorn app.main:app --reload   # then open http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

The browser chat is where the **user-facing** features live. The HTTP endpoints
(`/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics`, `/api/sessions`, `/api/history`) are where the
**operability** features live and are the easiest to verify with `curl`.

---

## 2. Core agent workflow (the MVP vertical)

| Feature | Where it lives | How to see / verify |
|---|---|---|
| End-to-end flow: probe → plan → standup → smoketest → run → parse report → summarize → teardown | `app/agent/loop.py`, `app/tools/*` | 🔵 In the chat: *"benchmark a small chat model on CPU"* and approve the plan (this is exactly the session you already ran). |
| **SessionPlan approval gate** — nothing mutating runs until you approve a structured plan | `app/validation/session_plan.py`, `propose_session_plan` tool | 🔵 Chat shows a plan card with Approve/Reject before any standup/run. |
| **Steering** (Claude-Code style) — type a message WHILE the agent is working; it's queued and the running turn picks it up at its next step (no concurrent turn, no "please wait"). Also covers type-instead-of-approve at a gate (declines + steers) | `app/agent/loop.py` (drains `ctx.steer_messages` each step), `app/main.py` (queues mid-turn `user_message` + backstop), `ui/app.js` (composer stays usable mid-turn) | 🔵 Start a turn, then send another message before it finishes — the agent folds it in. ⚪ `tests/test_ws.py::test_ws_typing_while_thinking_steers_the_same_turn`, `tests/test_loop.py::test_mid_thinking_steer_extends_the_same_turn`, `tests/test_concurrency.py::test_second_message_to_running_session_is_queued_as_steer`. |
| Use-case → `<spec, harness, workload>` triplet mapping (knowledge-driven, not hardcoded) | `knowledge/usecase_to_profile.yaml` | ⚪ Read the YAML; the LLM reasons over it (no `if/elif` in Python). |
| Concrete `llmdbenchmark run` argv + dry-run preview | `app/tools/execute.py` | 🔵 The "Executed commands" panel shows the exact argv; `--dry-run` is read-only. |
| Catalog grounding (specs/harnesses/workloads discovered from the repo, never invented) | `app/tools/probe.py:list_catalog` | 🔵 `list_catalog` runs read-only at session start. |

---

## 3. Chat UI features (what you actually see in the browser)

| Feature | Where | How to see / verify |
|---|---|---|
| llm-d brand theme (hexagon mark, Red Hat fonts), light/dark toggle | `ui/index.html`, `ui/styles.css` | 🔵 Open the app; click the theme toggle (top-right). Persists in `localStorage`. |
| **Recent chats sidebar + resume** (Claude-web style) | `ui/app.js`, `GET /api/sessions`, WS `?session=<id>` | 🟢 `GET /api/sessions` returns the stored chats (observed: 100+ sessions). Click one to replay its transcript. |
| **Stored Results sidebar + metric trend sparkline** | `ui/index.html` (`#history`, `#trend-view`), `GET /api/history`, `/api/history/trend` | 🟢 Endpoints live. The sparkline appears once a result is stored via `result_history`; the agent proactively stores the first real run of a session as a baseline (directed by `knowledge/history.md`), so a fresh `/api/history` populates after your first benchmark. |
| **Per-run charts shown inline under the report summary** | `GET /api/sessions/{sid}/artifact`, `app/tools/probe.py` (`charts`), `ui/app.js` (`renderReportCharts`) | 🟢 After `locate_and_parse_report`, the harness's latency/throughput PNGs render as captioned images in the results card (read-only, image-only, path-traversal-hardened route). |
| **Token-usage counter** (real provider counts) — **context-window chip** `⛶ N ctx` (under the chat input, right-aligned on the hint row) shows the current prompt size sent to the model on the latest call; raw count, no model-limit denominator since the active model can change; persists across reloads) + live per-turn `↑up ↓down · N this turn (X calls · Y cached)` | `app/agent/events.py` (`usage` event → `context_window`), `ui/app.js` (`onUsage`/`appendTurnTokens`/`setContextWindow`) | 🔵 Visible during/after any chat turn. |
| **Deterministic welcome card** — a consistent, code-emitted greeting (capability bullets + nudge) on a FRESH chat, NO LLM turn spent; never shown on resume | `knowledge/welcome.md` (judgment text), `app/agent/welcome.py` (parser), `app/main.py` (`welcome` event on `not resumed`), `ui/app.js` (`renderWelcome`) | 🔵 Open a new chat: the welcome card + suggestion chips appear before you type. ⚪ `tests/test_deterministic_msgs.py`. |
| **Structured post-run results card** — a deterministic summary (model/harness/requests + latency/throughput table + exact SLO verdicts + Pareto frontier for a sweep) built from the validated BR v0.2 summary, not LLM prose | `app/agent/results_card.py`, `app/agent/loop.py` (`results_card` event after the report/analysis tool), `ui/app.js` (`renderResultsCard`) | 🔵 After `locate_and_parse_report` / `analyze_results` the card renders identically every run. ⚪ `tests/test_deterministic_msgs.py`. |
| Animated "working" indicator (spinning llm-d hexagon + live status/tool name) | `ui/index.html` `#working`, `ui/app.js` | 🔵 Appears while the agent is thinking/running a tool. |
| Markdown rendering of assistant text | `ui/app.js` (renderer) | 🔵 Assistant replies render as formatted markdown. |
| Debug view (`>_`) — show the executed commands inline in the chat | `ui/index.html` `#debug-toggle`, `ui/app.js` `addInlineCommand` | 🔵 Toggle top-right; reveals each command the agent ran inline, between the messages, in execution order (badged read-only/mutating + auto/approved). Toggle off to hide. |
| Approval cards persist across chat switches | `ui/app.js` | 🔵 Switch chats with a pending approval; it's still there. |
| Per-command approval for mutating actions; read-only probes auto-run | `app/agent/loop.py`, `app/security/*` | 🔵 Standup/run/teardown prompt for approval; probes don't. |
| **Run progress stepper** — phased workflow rail (Pre-flight → Plan → Setup → Configure → Deploy → Benchmark → Analyze) that lights up as the agent works | `ui/index.html` `#run-steps`, `ui/app.js` (`renderRunSteps`/`advancePhase`) | 🔵 Appears once a benchmark starts; the active phase pulses. Per-chat (survives switches). Driven from the `tool_call` stream, no LLM cost. ⚪ `tests/test_ui_frontend.py`. |
| **Stop button** — cancel an in-flight run from the UI (sends the `cancel` control frame; handles the `cancelled` event) | `ui/app.js` (`cancelRun`), `app/main.py` (Phase-16 cancel) | 🔵 Visible in the working line during a run; click to stop. ⚪ `tests/test_ui_frontend.py`. |
| **Goodput gauge + binding constraint** in the results card — radial gauge of estimated goodput + the first missed SLO target | `ui/app.js` (`goodputGauge`, `renderResultsCard`) | 🔵 Renders in the SLO section of the results card when goodput is computed. |
| **Pareto frontier scatter** (sweeps) — 2D objective-space plot with the frontier highlighted + SLO-infeasible points ringed | `ui/app.js` (`renderParetoCard`/`scatterPlot`) | 🔵 After `analyze_results` on a sweep. Renders from the per-run objective coordinates already on the result. |
| **A/B comparison delta bars** + **cross-harness table** | `ui/app.js` (`renderComparisonCard`/`deltaBar`, `renderHarnessCompareCard`) | 🔵 After `compare_reports` (direction-aware green/red deltas vs baseline) / `compare_harness_runs`. |
| **Live per-pod CPU/mem trend sparklines** in the resource side-panel | `ui/app.js` (`accumulateResourceHistory`/`renderResourceTrends`) | 🔵 During a run the side-panel shows rolling sparklines under the kubectl-top table. |
| **Copy buttons** on code/JSON blocks, **jump-to-latest**, **off-canvas mobile sidebar** | `ui/app.js`, `ui/styles.css` | 🔵 Hover a code block for Copy; scroll up for the Latest button; narrow the window for the hamburger. ⚪ `tests/test_ui_frontend.py`. |
| **Pre-flight / status cards** — the read-only diagnostic tools render as friendly status cards instead of raw JSON: `probe_environment` → environment status grid; `check_capacity` → feasibility + diagnostics; `check_endpoint_readiness` → services/gateway/serving grid; `advise_accelerators` → CPU-only/accelerated + node table; `generate_doe_experiment` → treatment matrix; `orchestrate_benchmark_run` → outcome + per-attempt fault timeline | `ui/app.js` (`renderEnvStatus`/`renderCapacityCard`/`renderReadinessCard`/`renderAcceleratorCard`/`renderDoeCard`/`renderOrchestrateCard`) | 🔵 Each renders after its tool runs. ⚪ `tests/test_ui_frontend.py`. |
| **Actionable "next steps" chips** — the analyzer's ranked `next_steps` render as clickable chips; a tap sends the step so the agent carries it out (save baseline, compare, sweep…) | `ui/app.js` (`renderNextSteps`) | 🔵 Appear under an `analyze_results` card. ⚪ `tests/test_ui_frontend.py`. |
| **Copy-summary on results cards** — hover-reveal button copies a markdown summary (metrics + SLO table) to paste into a report/PR | `ui/app.js` (`resultsCardMarkdown`/`addCardCopy`) | 🔵 Hover a benchmark results card; click Copy. ⚪ `tests/test_ui_frontend.py`. |
| **Guided Benchmark Builder** — a "✨ Design" wizard (header + welcome CTA) where a non-expert picks use-case / scale / token-shape / SLO targets / hardware via chips & inputs, sees a live plain-language preview, and sends it as a normal message. The agent does ALL `<scenario, harness, workload>` mapping — the form only phrases the request (thin code / thick agent) | `ui/index.html` `#builder`, `ui/app.js` (`composeBrief`/`openBuilder`/`submitBuilder`) | 🔵 Click "✨ Design", choose options, Send. ⚪ `tests/test_ui_frontend.py`. |
| **Share a chat via link** (ChatGPT-style) — the "🔗" header button mints a **read-only public link** to an *immutable snapshot* of the conversation; copy it, or delete it to revoke. Opening `/share/<token>` serves the same SPA read-only (no composer / sidebar / WebSocket) and replays the snapshot with the live transcript renderers. The link bypasses the optional Bearer auth (the unguessable token is the credential); minting/revoking stay owner-gated; pending approval gates are stripped from the snapshot | `app/storage/share.py` (`ShareStore`), `app/main.py` (`POST /api/sessions/{id}/share`, `GET /api/share/{token}`, `GET /share/{token}`, `DELETE /api/share/{token}`), `app/security/auth.py` (public-GET exemption), `ui/index.html` `#share-dialog`, `ui/app.js` (`shareChat`/`bootShareView`) | 🔵 Click 🔗 on a started chat → copy the link → open it in a private window. ⚪ `tests/test_share.py`, `tests/test_ui_frontend.py`. |
| **UI preview harness** — drive every render path with fixture data, no backend/LLM | `ui/preview.html` | 🔵 Open `/static/preview.html` (or serve `ui/` and open `preview.html`) to see all of the above without a cluster. |

---

## 4. The agent tools (authoritative list — `app/tools/registry.py`)

> Note: `app/tools/registry.py:build_registry` is the authoritative count — read it (the
> enumerated list below mirrors it). `run_shell` is registered as one extra tool ONLY when the
> operator sets `UNRESTRICTED_TOOLS` — off by default.

**Sensing / grounding (read-only, auto-run):** `probe_environment`, `list_catalog`,
`inspect_workload_profile`, `estimate_run_duration`, `read_knowledge`, `search_knowledge`,
`read_repo_doc`, `fetch_key_docs`, `check_capacity`, `check_endpoint_readiness`,
`locate_and_parse_report`, `observe_run_metrics`, `discover_stack`, `advise_accelerators`.

**Planning / authoring:** `propose_session_plan`, `write_and_validate_config`,
`generate_doe_experiment`, `convert_guide_to_scenario`.

**Mutating (approval-gated):** `ensure_repos`, `run_setup`, `execute_llmdbenchmark`,
`run_command`, `orchestrate_benchmark_run`, `orchestrate_sweep` (parallel DoE-treatment Jobs
under a concurrency cap, with per-treatment retry/dead-letter + checkpoint/resume — the
proposal's parallel-treatment scheduling), `manage_orchestrated_runs` (list **read-only** /
stop / reap the orchestrator's K8s Jobs ON the cluster — `stop` deletes a still-running Job,
which `cancel_run` does NOT; also mirrored read-only at `GET /api/jobs`), `provision_hf_secret`.

**Analysis / history (read-only):** `compare_reports`, `compare_harness_runs`,
`analyze_results`, `aggregate_runs`, `result_history`, `cancel_run`.

**Closed-loop goal-seeking (read-only, auto-run):** `autotune_search` — the autotuner's
search-state tracker for an adaptive search to an SLO at best goodput. Tracks the trial log,
validates the agent's next candidate (bounds/duplicate/budget), and surfaces convergence
FACTS (incumbent, SLO-feasible frontier via the reused `pareto_analysis`, budget remaining).
It computes NO next config and returns NO converge/stop verdict — the strategy + stop
decision live in `knowledge/autotune_strategy.md`. Rides one upfront `SessionPlan.autotune`
approval.

**Resilience (opt-in, double-gated, hermetic):** `run_resilience_drill` — inject faults via a
`KubeClient` decorator + prove restart durability; returns a resilience report. Requires
`CHAOS_ENABLED=true`; runs against an in-process cluster (never a real one).

**Reproducibility (read-only):** `export_run_bundle` (capture a provenance bundle — repo
SHAs + resolved config + validated report digest), `reproduce_run` (re-derive a rerun
proposal that goes back through the SessionPlan-approval + `--dry-run` gates).

**Conversation / UX (read-only, auto-run):** `suggest_next_steps` — offer 2-4 concrete
follow-ups as clickable buttons instead of a prose "want me to…?"; the agent's turn-ending
discretionary offer (NOT an approval gate — mutations still go through their own gates). See
`knowledge/conversation_style.md`.

*How to verify each tool:* every tool has a focused test in `tests/` (e.g.
`tests/test_new_tools.py`, `tests/test_analyze.py`, `tests/test_capacity.py`,
`tests/test_history.py`). In the chat, each tool call renders as a card with its inputs and
result.

## 5. Benchmark Orchestrator (Kubernetes-native, §3.3)

| Feature | Where | How to see / verify |
|---|---|---|
| Job-per-run / per-DOE-treatment manifest generation | `app/orchestrator/job.py:build_job_manifest` | ⚪ `pytest tests/test_orchestrator.py`; or `orchestrate_benchmark_run` in chat (needs a cluster). |
| Fault classification (OOM / timeout / unschedulable / evicted / image / run error) | `app/orchestrator/faults.py` (6 kinds) | ⚪ `tests/test_orchestrator_faults.py`; surfaces as `llmdbench_orchestrator_run_faults_total` in `/metrics`. |
| Retry + dead-letter for transient faults; deterministic faults never retry | `controller.py:run_with_retries` | ⚪ `tests/test_orchestrator_retry.py`. |
| Parallel DOE sweeps with a concurrency cap | `controller.py:run_sweep` (`asyncio.Semaphore`) | ⚪ `tests/test_orchestrator_sweep.py`, `tests/test_sweep.py`. |
| **Stateless reconstruct** from Job/pod labels | `controller.py:reconstruct` | ⚪ `tests/test_orchestrator_controller.py`. |
| **Real-time pod log streaming** → live `output` events during a run (P21) | `controller.run_attempt` + `kube.stream_logs(follow=True)` | 🔵 Run `orchestrate_benchmark_run` on a cluster; logs stream into the console panel live, not just at the end. |
| **Checkpoint / resume** of long DOE sweeps via a per-sweep ConfigMap (P22) | `app/orchestrator/checkpoint.py` | ⚪ `tests/test_orchestrator*`; resume a sweep with the same `sweep_id` → completed treatments are skipped. |
| **Resource management** — nodeSelector / tolerations / affinity / GPU type + pod anti-affinity (P23) | `JobSpec`/`build_job_manifest` + `knowledge/resource_management.md` | ⚪ Pass `scheduling` to `orchestrate_benchmark_run`; inspect the rendered manifest in tests. |
| **Endpoint readiness gate** before submit (+ approval-gated standup suggestion) (P24) | `app/orchestrator/readiness.py`, `check_endpoint_readiness` tool | ⚪ `tests/test_readyz.py` + tool tests; reads `kubectl get endpoints`, refuses to submit against an unready endpoint. |
| **Resilience / chaos drill** — opt-in fault injection (a `KubeClient` decorator rewriting cluster reads → faults flow through the UNMODIFIED classify→retry/dead-letter path) + restart-durability proof + a resilience report. Double-gated (`CHAOS_ENABLED` + the named tool); hermetic (in-process cluster). | `app/orchestrator/chaos.py` / `resilience.py` / `restart.py`, `run_resilience_drill` tool + `knowledge/resilience.md` | ⚪ `tests/test_chaos_injection.py`, `tests/test_orchestrator_restart.py`, `tests/test_resilience_report.py`, `tests/test_resilience_tool.py`; surfaces as `llmdbench_orchestrator_faults_injected_total` in `/metrics`. |
| Cleanup of terminal Jobs/ConfigMaps; results PVC preserved | `controller.py:cleanup` | ⚪ orchestrator tests. |

---

## 6. Results analysis, comparison & history (§3.4)

| Feature | Where | How to see / verify |
|---|---|---|
| Report parsing + plain-language summary (validated against repo BR-v0.2 schema) | `app/validation/report.py`, `locate_and_parse_report` | 🔵 The "Benchmark results" card you saw in chat. ⚪ `tests/test_report_validation.py`. |
| SLO-aware filtering + **goodput estimate** + Pareto/DoE frontier | `app/validation/analysis.py`, `analyze_results` | ⚪ `tests/test_analyze.py`. |
| A/B comparison of 2+ runs (per-metric deltas + per-metric winner) | `app/tools/compare.py` | ⚪ `tests/` (compare). |
| **Cross-harness** comparison (inference-perf vs guidellm on the same stack) | `app/tools/multiharness.py` | ⚪ `tests/test_multiharness.py`. |
| Metric extraction incl. **KV-cache hit rate, schedule delay, GPU utilization** (P25) | `report.py`/`analysis.py` + `knowledge/standard_metrics.yaml` | ⚪ tests; `None` when a harness doesn't emit them. |
| **Cross-session result history** (`store`/`list`/`get`/`delete`) | `app/storage/history.py`, `result_history` tool, `GET /api/history` | 🟢 `GET /api/history` returns `records` + the 11 trendable `metrics`. Store one in chat to populate it. |
| **Metric trends over time** (`trend`) + sidebar sparkline | `GET /api/history/trend?metric=<m>` | 🟢 Live (see evidence). Valid metrics: `ttft, tpot, itl, request_latency, output_token_rate, total_token_rate, request_rate, success_rate_pct, kv_cache_hit_rate, gpu_utilization, schedule_delay`. |

> ✅ **The harness's own PNG charts are surfaced inline.** `inference-perf` writes
> `latency_vs_qps.png`, `throughput_vs_latency.png`, `throughput_vs_qps.png` into the session
> `analysis/` folder; `locate_and_parse_report` returns them as a `charts` list, the read-only
> `GET /api/sessions/{sid}/artifact` route serves the bytes (image-only, traversal-hardened), and
> the report-summary card renders them inline as captioned images alongside the text summary +
> trend sparkline.

---

## 7. Observability (§4, Phase 7 + 17)

| Feature | Where | How to see / verify |
|---|---|---|
| Prometheus metrics endpoint (agent's own counters/histograms/gauges) | `app/observability/metrics.py`, `GET /metrics` | 🟢 `curl /metrics` — exposes `llmdbench_agent_commands_total`, `_command_duration_seconds`, `llmdbench_orchestrator_run_attempts_total`, `_run_faults_total`, `_runs_in_flight`, `_runs_submitted_total`, `_runs_terminal_total`. |
| Live cluster resource usage during a run (`kubectl top`) | `app/tools/observe.py`, `observe_run_metrics` tool | 🔵 Call it while a run is in flight (needs the in-cluster metrics-server, which kind / the `cicd/kind` spec do NOT install — add it separately). |
| Per-cluster metrics-server installer (enables the live stats above) | `scripts/install_metrics_server.sh`, `install_metrics_server.sh` allowlist exec | 🔵 `probe_environment` reports `metrics_server.available` up front (pre-flight); on kind where it is false the agent OFFERS `run_command(["install_metrics_server.sh","--kubelet-insecure-tls"])` BEFORE the run (mutating → approval). Judgment in `knowledge/observability.md`; rule in `app/agent/prompt.py` HARD_RULES. |
| Grafana dashboard + Prometheus scrape config + **alert rules** | `deploy/observability/{grafana-dashboard.json,prometheus-scrape.yaml,alerts.rules.yaml}` | ⚪ Files render/import directly. |

---

## 8. Security & trust

| Feature | Where | How to see / verify |
|---|---|---|
| **Deny-by-default allowlist**, argv-only (`shell=False`), policy-as-data | `security/allowlist.yaml`, `app/security/allowlist.py` | ⚪ `tests/test_allowlist.py`; `/readyz` reports "15 allowlisted executables". |
| Read-only probes auto-run; mutating commands require UI approval | `app/agent/loop.py`, `app/security/runner.py` | 🔵 Standup prompts; probes don't. |
| Secrets stay backend-only; child-process env scrubbed | `app/config.py:child_env` | ⚪ Read `child_env`; browser never receives keys. |
| **Allowlist governance** — per-command timeouts + usage quotas (P13) | `app/security/quota.py`, `security/allowlist.yaml` | ⚪ `tests/test_governance.py`. |
| **Optional Bearer-token auth** (`AUTH_ENABLED`/`AUTH_TOKEN`) → 401 on missing/bad (P12) | `app/security/auth.py` | 🟢 With auth on: no token → **401** + `www-authenticate: Bearer`; correct token → **200** (see evidence). |
| **Token-bucket rate limit** (`RATE_LIMIT_*`) → 429 when drained (P12) | `app/security/auth.py` (`rate_limit` dependency) | 🟢 With `RPS=1 BURST=2`: first request 200, rest **429** (see evidence). |
| Optional CORS (`CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS`); off = no CORS headers (today's default) | `app/config.py:cors_origins_list`, `app/main.py` | ⚪ Set the env var and inspect response headers. |

---

## 9. Operability & lifecycle (roadmap v2)

| Feature | Where | How to see / verify |
|---|---|---|
| **Structured JSON logging + correlation IDs** (P11) | `app/observability/logging.py`, `logctx.py` | 🟢 Server stdout is JSON (`{"timestamp":...,"level":"INFO","logger":"app.main","message":"startup",...}`). |
| Liveness `/healthz` | `app/main.py` | 🟢 `{"ok":true}`. |
| **Readiness `/readyz` + startup self-check** (P16/P18) — workspace writable, provider coherent, repos resolvable, runner ok, auth coherent | `app/main.py`, `app/storage/retention.py` | 🟢 `curl /readyz` returns the full per-check report (all green here). |
| **Run lifecycle**: cancel a run in another chat, reattach, graceful shutdown (P16) | `app/tools/cancel.py` (`cancel_run`), `app/agent/lifecycle.py` | ⚪ `tests/test_run_lifecycle.py`; 🔵 `cancel_run` frees a stuck run's concurrency slot. |
| Concurrency cap on simultaneous runs | `app/agent/*`, `tests/test_concurrency.py` | ⚪ `tests/test_concurrency.py`. |
| **WS protocol hardening + live event buffer** (P15) | `app/agent/ws_schemas.py`, `channel.py` | ⚪ `tests/test_ws.py`. |
| **Workspace retention / GC + startup cleanup** (P18) | `app/storage/retention.py` | 🟢 Startup log: `{"message":"retention.gc","removed":0,"reclaimed_bytes":0}`. |
| **Simulate Mode** (`SIMULATE=1`) — walk the whole flow, execute nothing, synthetic report | `app/config.py`, tool handlers, `app/agent/loop.py` | 🔵 Set `SIMULATE=1`, run a benchmark in chat — every command is a no-op, a synthetic report is produced, no cluster touched. ⚪ `tests/test_simulate.py`. |

---

## 10. Deploy & packaging (Phase 8)

| Feature | Where | How to see / verify |
|---|---|---|
| Hardened non-root container image | `Dockerfile` | ⚪ `docker build .`. |
| **Helm chart** (Deployment, Service, SA, RBAC Role/Binding, Secret) | `deploy/helm/llm-d-benchmarking-agent/` | 🟢 `helm template deploy/helm/llm-d-benchmarking-agent` renders all 6 kinds. |
| **Kustomize base + overlay** | `deploy/kustomize/{base,overlays/example}/` | 🟢 `kubectl kustomize deploy/kustomize/base` renders SA, Role, RoleBinding, Service, Deployment. |
| Least-privilege RBAC | `deploy/*/rbac.yaml` | ⚪ Inspect the rendered Role rules. |
| Single source of truth for image/port/SA across artifacts | `app/packaging/assets.py` | ⚪ `tests/test_packaging.py`. |

---

## 11. Quality, validation & CI

| Feature | Where | How to see / verify |
|---|---|---|
| Pytest suite (unit + integration of mechanism) | `tests/` (40+ files) | ⚪ `make test` → green (a handful of env-gated tests skip by default). |
| **Quality gates: ruff + mypy + coverage** (P14) | `pyproject.toml`, `Makefile` | ⚪ `make quality` (= `lint` + `typecheck` + `coverage`). |
| **Flow-validation harness** (hermetic walk of the whole agent flow) | `tests/flows/`, `docs/VALIDATION.md` | ⚪ `make flows` / `make validate`. |
| Catalog snapshot test (guards against repo drift) | `tests/flows/catalog_snapshot.py` | ⚪ `make snapshot-catalog`. |
| **llm-d-inference-sim integration tests** (opt-in, env-gated, skipped by default) (P26) | `tests/integration/` (+ non-gating CI job) | ⚪ Enable the env gate to run against the CPU mock; hermetic sim-shaped coverage always runs. |

## 12. Knowledge base (thick-agent — all judgment lives here)

The agent's decisions are **data**, not Python. Verify by reading `knowledge/`:
`usecase_to_profile.yaml`, `sweep_playbook.md`, `welllit_path_advisor.yaml` (P20),
`resource_management.md` (P23), `standard_metrics.yaml` (P25), `analysis.md`,
`results_interpretation.md`, `multi_harness.md`, `capacity.md`, `orchestrator.md`,
`observability.md`, `history.md`, `run_lifecycle.md`, `key_docs.yaml`. The system prompt
inlines the core guides; `read_knowledge('<topic>')` pulls in the rest on demand.

**Prompt-token efficiency (token-tracking merge):** fixed prompt overhead was cut ~40%
(`~20.4K → ~12.3K`), schema `title`s are stripped (`registry.py:_strip_titles`), and
**provider-agnostic prompt caching** is wired in (`app/llm/*`). Verify via the per-turn token
line in the UI (`· Y cached`).

## Evidence log

Reference shapes captured live against a fresh server (`uvicorn app.main:app`); these are the
expected responses, not the test runs.

**Plain instance:**
```
GET /healthz   → {"ok":true}
GET /readyz    → 200 {"ready":true,"self_check":{checks:[workspace_writable, provider_coherent,
                 repos_resolvable (llm-d, llm-d-benchmark), runner_ok (allowlisted execs),
                 auth_coherent]}}
GET /metrics   → Prometheus: llmdbench_agent_commands_total, _command_duration_seconds,
                 llmdbench_orchestrator_run_attempts_total, _run_faults_total, _runs_in_flight,
                 _runs_submitted_total, _runs_terminal_total
GET /api/sessions → persisted chats (id/title/message_count)
GET /api/history  → {"records":[...], "metrics":[ttft,tpot,itl,request_latency,output_token_rate,
                    total_token_rate,request_rate,success_rate_pct,kv_cache_hit_rate,
                    gpu_utilization,schedule_delay]}
GET /api/history/trend?metric=<unknown> → graceful 200 error + available_metrics
GET /api/history/trend?metric=ttft       → {"metric":"ttft","better":"lower","points":[...]}
startup log → JSON {"message":"startup",...} ; {"message":"retention.gc",...}
```

**Auth/rate-limit instance (`AUTH_ENABLED=true AUTH_TOKEN=… RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true RPS=1 BURST=2`):**
```
GET /api/sessions (no token)      → 401 {"detail":"missing or invalid bearer token"} + www-authenticate: Bearer
GET /api/sessions (Bearer <tok>)  → 200
GET /healthz|/readyz (no token)   → 200  (liveness/readiness probes are auth-exempt for kubelets)
6× rapid authed GET /api/sessions → 200, then 429 until the bucket refills
artifact route                    → real chart PNG byte-identical (image/png); ../ / non-image / unknown-session → 404
```

**Artifacts:**
```
kubectl kustomize deploy/kustomize/base            → ServiceAccount, Role, RoleBinding, Service, Deployment
helm template deploy/helm/llm-d-benchmarking-agent → + Secret  (6 kinds total)
```

## Findings / caveats

No open caveats. Five early findings (orphaned harness PNG charts behind `/static`; empty trend
sparkline until a result is stored; `/healthz`+`/readyz` wrongly auth-gated; `CLAUDE.md` tool-count
drift; ambiguous latency units) were all **fixed on 2026-06-02** (`1515959`, merged `3363496`) — done.

**Counts (current).** Verified against the running app: the agent tools enumerated in §4
(authoritative: `registry.py:build_registry`; `run_shell` adds one more only with `UNRESTRICTED_TOOLS`), **11 trendable history metrics** (incl. `kv_cache_hit_rate`,
`gpu_utilization`, `schedule_delay`), **15 allowlisted executables**, **7 `/metrics` families**.
All ROADMAP_V4 active phases (27–66) are merged; 7 are explicitly deferred (34/43/44/47/52/57/58 —
see `ROADMAP_V4.md`).
